# NLP_Projects
 NLP is not science, it is applied science. It is an engineering discipline that combines the power of artificial intelligence, computational linguistics and computer science, to “understand” natural language. Second, Machine Learning and Deep Learning are not NLP. They can be used to solve NLP problems, as much as they can be used to solve a large number of problems not related to natural language processing.
